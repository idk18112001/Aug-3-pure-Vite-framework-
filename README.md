# LucidQuant - Frontend-Only Deployment Guide

## For Vercel Deployment (Frontend-Only)

This application is now configured as a pure frontend-only React application using Vite, perfect for Vercel deployment.

### Quick Deployment Steps:

1. **Clone/Upload to GitHub**:
   - Push this repository to GitHub
   - Make sure the following files are in the root:
     - `index.html`
     - `src/` folder (frontend code)
     - `vercel.json` (deployment config)

2. **Deploy on Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically detect this as a Vite project
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`

### Project Structure:
```
